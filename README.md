Spring AOP enables Aspect-Oriented Programming in spring applications

### Introduction
** Spring AOP enables Aspect-Oriented Programming in spring applications. In AOP, aspects enable
the modularization of concerns such as transaction management, logging or security that 
cut across multiple types and objects (often termed crosscutting concerns).

AOP provides the way to dynamically add the cross-cutting concern before, after or around 
the actual logic using simple pluggable configurations. It makes easy to maintain code in 
the present and future as well. You can add/remove concerns without recompiling
complete sourcecode simply by changing configuration files 
(if you are applying aspects suing XML configuration).**


### What is advice, joinpoint and pointcut
```
An important term in AOP is advice. It is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join-point.
1. **_Joinpoint_** is a point of execution of the program, such as the execution 
of a method or the handling of an exception.In Spring AOP, a joinpoint always represents a method execution.
2. **_Pointcut_** is a predicate or expression that matches join points.
3. **_Advice_** is associated with a pointcut expression and runs at any join point matched by the pointcut.
4.Spring uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language by default.**
```

### Types of AOP advices
```
1. **_Before advice_** : Advice that executes before a join point, but which does not have the ability 
to prevent execution flow proceeding to the join point (unless it throws an exception).
2. **_After returning advice_**: Advice to be executed after a join point completes normally: 
for example, if a method returns without throwing an exception.
3. **_After throwing advice_** : Advice to be executed if a method exits by throwing an exception.
4. **_After advice_** : Advice to be executed regardless of the means by which a 
join point exits (normal or exceptional return).
5. **_Around advice_** : Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method invocation. 
This is the most powerful kind of advice. Around advice can perform custom behavior before and 
after the method invocation. It is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the 
join point or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own return 
value or throwing an exception.**
